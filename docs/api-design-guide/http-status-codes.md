## HTTP Status Response codes

Try to minimize the number of HTTP status codes a REST API returns. When
more details are needed in a error response use application defined errors
and supply them in a response error object, described in the [errors] document.

For each HTTP method, you should try to use only status
codes marked with **X** in the following table.

| Code | Meaning      | GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE |
| :--- | :----------- | :-: | :--: | :-: | :---: | :----: |
| 200  | OK           |  X  |      |  X  |   X   |   X    |
| 201  | Created      |     |  X   |     |       |        |
| 204  | No Content   |     |      |  X  |   X   |   X    |
| 400  | Bad Request  |     |  X   |  X  |   X   |        |
| 401  | Unauthorized |  X  |  X   |  X  |   X   |   X    |
| 403  | Forbidden    |  X  |  X   |  X  |   X   |   X    |
| 404  | Not Found    |  X  |      |  X  |   X   |        |
| 500  | Server error |  X  |  X   |  X  |   X   |   X    |

- General for all methods

  - `401` should be returned when client fails to authenticate.
  - `403` should be returned when client is authenticated but does not have
    necessary permission to perform the operation.
  - `500` should be returned when the server encounters some unexpected error,
    preferably along with an [errors] object.

- `GET` for retrieving a resource or a collection of resources.

  - `200` should be returned on success.
    If a collection asked for is empty, `200` is still to be returned.
  - `404` should be returned when a resource asked for is not found.

- `POST` for creating a resource.

  - `201` should be returned if the resource was created. The response
    body should contain a resource identifier to the created resource.
  - `400` should be returned if the request is invalid, i.e. the resource
    already exists or contains invalid fields.

- `PUT` for updating a existing resource.

  - `200` should be returned after a successful execution,
    when there is a need for content in the response.
  - `204` should be returned after a successful execution,
    as usually there is no need for content in the response.
  - `400` should be returned if the request is invalid,
    i.e. the resource contains invalid fields.
  - `404` should be returned if the resource to be updated is not found.

- `PATCH` for making a partial update on a resource.

  - `200` should be returned after a successful execution,
    when there is a need for content in the response.
  - `204` should be returned after a successful execution,
    as usually there is no need for content in the response.
  - `400` should be returned if the request is invalid,
    i.e. the resource contains invalid fields.
  - `404` should be returned if the resource to be updated is not found.

- `DELETE` for removing a resource.
  - `200` can be returned after a successful execution,
    when there is a need for a content in the response.
  - `204` should be returned after a successful execution  
    **Note:** If a client asks for the removal of a resource already deleted
    `204` should be returned, **not** `404`, because clients usually do not care
    if a resource was previously deleted.
