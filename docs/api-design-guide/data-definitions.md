# Data Definitions and Standards

## Text encoding

APIs should represent all texts in the [UTF-8] encoding.

## JSON

Primitive values MUST be serialized to JSON following the rules of [RFC8259] and,
as stated in the standard, JSON text MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].

JSON can represent four primitive types _strings_, _numbers_, _booleans_, and
_null_ and two structured types _objects_ and _arrays_. Concepts like
[Date and Time] need to be represented using these types.

## Data transfer objects

Data transfer objects, or DTOs, are objects used to wrap resource definitions in
request/response objects along with additional information.

In a response body, you should return a JSON object, not an array, as a top
level data structure to support future extensibility. This would allow you to
extend your response and, for example, add a server side pagination attribute.

**Bad response body**

```
[
    { "id": "1", "name": "Einar"   },
    { "id": "2", "name": "Erlendur"},
    { "id": "3", "name": "Valdimar"}
]
```

**Good response body**

```
{
  "users":[
    { "id": "1001", "name": "Einar"},
    { "id": "1002", "name": "Erlendur"},
    { "id": "1003", "name": "Valdimar"},
  ]
}

// With pagination fields
{
  "users":[
    { "id": "1001", "name": "Einar"},
    { "id": "1002", "name": "Erlendur"},
    { "id": "1003", "name": "Valdimar"},
  ],
  "nextCursor": "aWQ6MTAwNA==",
}
```

## Pagination

All services should support pagination from the start, even though the
dataset is small. It is harder to add it later on as it would break the
service interface for current users.

Pagination should be implemented using _Cursor_. Cursor pagination solves
the missing or duplication of data problems that the typical offset method has.
Cursor pagination returns a cursor in the response, which is a pointer to
a specific item in the dataset. This pointer needs to be a unique sequential
field (or fields).

When implementing cursor pagination a field called `nextCursor` is returned
in the response object. This field is a Base64 encoded string. Having it encoded
makes it uniform while providing flexibility to implement different cursor logic
between different endpoints. In the example above the `nextCursor` field is
a Base64 encoding the value `id:1004`, meaning the server is using the `id` field
of the user object as a pointer to next item.

To indicate there are no more results the value of `nextCursor` is set to the
empty string: `"nextCursor": ""`.

Optionally, an API can also provide the field `totalCount` to indicate to the
client how many results are available.

### Pagination query parameters

For an API to support pagination it needs to support the following query parameters:

- `cursor` - The client provides the value of `nextCursor` from the previous
  response to set the start of next page of results.
- `limit` - Limits the number of results in a request. The server should have
  a default value for this field.

## National identifier

Icelandic individuals are uniquely identified by a national identifier called
`kennitala`. When referring to this identifier in URIs, requests, or responses,
APIs should use the name `nationalId`. Its value is usually represented to
users in the form `######-####` but APIs should use the form `##########` at
all times.

## Language and currency

- **Languages** - When specifying a language please use the [ISO-639-1]
  (two letter) standard. See: [639-1 codes].
- **Currencies** - When specifying currency codes please use the [ISO-4217]
  standard. See: [4217 codes].
  - **Amount** - Use the format `[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?` to represent an amount.
    Separate amount and currency in different fields. Example amount:
    `1250.23`.

## Date and time

Date and time values should be represented in a string, as described in the
[RFC3339] proposed standard. The standard defines a profile of [ISO 8601]
for use in Internet protocols. See: [Section 5.6] for Date/Time Format.

### Summary for date and time

Date and time should be represented as a string using
the format `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ`. Where

- **yyyy** represents year, (four-digits).
- **MM** represents month, (two-digits _01 - 12_).
- **dd** represents day of month, (two-digits _01 - 31_).
- **hh** represents hour, (two digits _00 - 24_).
- **mm** represents minute, (two digits _00 - 59_).
- **ss** represents second, (two digits _00 - 59_).
- **sss** represents a decimal fraction of a second, (one or more digits).
- **Z** represents a time zone offset specified as `Z` (for [UTC]) or either
  `+` or `-` followed by a time expression `hh:mm`.

Icelandic local time can be represented with `Z` because Iceland follows
the [UTC] +00:00 all year round, which is the same as [GMT].

Examples:

- `1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z` represents 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after
  the 23rd hour of April 12th, 1985 in [UTC].

- `1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00` represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the
  16th hour of December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from [UTC] (Pacific
  Standard Time). Note that this is equivalent to `1996-12-20T00:39:57Z`
  in UTC.

## Timestamp data

All returned data should contain the field `createdTimestamp` and it's value
should be the [date and time] when the data was created. This is important
because of different caching rules and different viewpoints on when data should
be considered obsolete.
