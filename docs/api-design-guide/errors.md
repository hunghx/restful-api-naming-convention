# Error Handling

This document describes how REST APIs should present errors to clients
consuming their services.

When an error occurs in a API, the service should return the error to the calling
client in an informative and structured manner. The API should return
information about the error in the response body.

## Response body

When an error occurs, a REST API should respond with an 4xx or 500x
[HTTP status code] and the response should contain an error object as
described below.

### Error object

The response should contain the key `error` and it's value should be a JSON object
containing at least the two keys, `code` and `message`. If there were multiple
errors, the values of `code` and `message` should describe the first error.

- `error` The key of the error object.
  - `code` _(Number)_ An integer number that indicates the error type that
    occurred. This value will usually represent the HTTP response code.
  - `message` _(String)_ A human readable string providing more details about the error.
  - `errors` _(Array)_ **(Optional)** More detailed information about the
    error(s). API developers can structure each object in the array as they
    like, but should, whenever possible, use that structure throughout the
    application. For example, the following fields could be included in each
    object of the array.
    - `help` **(Optional)** URL to a page explaining the error and possible
      solutions.
    - `trackingId` **(Optional)** Identifier for mapping failures to service
      internal codes.
    - `param` **(Optional)** Name of the parameter which was incorrect.
    - `code` and `message` **(Optional)** could provide more detailed
      information about a specific error, like when parsing parameters.

#### REST error response examples

Simple response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "File Not Found"
  }
}
```

More detailed response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Bad Request - parameter incorrect",
    "errors": [
      {
        "code": 87,
        "message": "Parameter is incorrectly formatted",
        "help": "https://www.moa.is/awesome/documetation/devices",
        "trackingId": "5d17a8ada52a2327f02c6a1a",
        "param": "deviceId"
      },
      {
        "code": 85,
        "message": "Parameter missing",
        "help": "https://www.moa.is/awesome/documetation/devices",
        "trackingId": "5d17a8ada52a2327f02c6a1c",
        "param": "deviceName"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
