# Once Only Principle

The [Once Only Principle] is an e-government concept that aims to ensure that
citizens, institutions, and companies only have to provide certain standard
information to the authorities and administrations once. By incorporating data
protection regulations and the explicit consent of the users, the public
administration is allowed to re-use and exchange the data with each other. The
once-only principle is part of the European Union's (EU) plans to further develop
the Digital Single Market by reducing the administrative burden on citizens and
businesses.

- Public service customers (citizens, institutions, and companies) should not
  have to supply the same information more than once to public administrations.

- APIs should store collected data in a single database. That means for example
  when a service is enriching existing data from another database it should store
  the enriched data in it's own database, with only a linkable identifier to the
  existing data.
