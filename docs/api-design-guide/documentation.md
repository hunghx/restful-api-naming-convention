# Documentation

API documentation should be targeted towards the developer that will consume the
API. A good documentation is one of the single most important qualities of an API.
It makes it much easier for other developers to use services and significantly
reduces implementation time for API consumers. The API developer is responsible
for keeping the documentation up to date.

To help with keeping documentation up to date consider using automatic
generation tools that during build time can, for example, gather comments in
predefined syntax and generate the [Open API Specification] (OAS), this means that
the OAS lives bundled with the code and should be easier for developers to maintain.

**Note** - To be able to register a **REST** service to _Viskuausan_
the service **MUST** provide an [OPENAPI 3] service description.

The following fields are required for services to be automatically imported to _Viskuausan_:

- info
  - description — short but proper description of the API.
  - version — to distinguish API versions following [semantic versioning]
    specification.
  - title — descriptive name of the API.
  - contact — information on who to contact about an issue with the service.
    - name — of the person or a department.
    - email — fully qualified email.
  - x-category — What kind of data does this service work with.
    - Possible values: `open`, `official`, `personal`, `health`, `financial`.
  - x-pricing — Cost of using this service.
    - Possible values: `free`, `paid`.
  - x-links — Links regarding the service.
    - responsibleParty — a fully qualified url to an online page containing
      information about the responsible party/owner of the service.
    - documentation — (_Optional_) a fully qualified url to the API
      documentation page.
    - bugReport (_Optional_) — a fully qualified url to an online page or
      form a consumer can report bugs about the service.
    - featureRequest (_Optional_) — a fully qualified url to an online page
      or form a consumer can ask for a new feature in api service.

Example can be found [here](#example).

## Describe error handling

Provide information on which HTTP status codes a client consuming
your service can expect the API to return, and provide information
on application defined errors and how the errors are presented to clients.
See [Errors] for further details.

## Provide feedback mechanism

Provide users with a way to comment on your documentation. This will help
with finding concepts that need further explanation and keeping the
documentation up to date.

The field x-links in the OpenAPI schema provides a way to include paths where
consumers can provide feedback on the API.
